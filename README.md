Earthquake maps.  Create a Compute Engine instance with the necessary Access and Security.  SSH into the instance. Install software package GIT. Ingest real-time earthquake data into a Compute Engine instance.  Transform data on the Compute Engine instance. Store the transformed data on Cloud Storage.  Publish Cloud Storage data to the web.    



Analyzing data using Datalab and BigQuery.  Launch Cloud Datalab. Invoke a BigQuery query.  Create graphs in Datalab.  Carry out data exploration of a large (70 million rows, 8 GB) airline dataset.  The “trick” is to do the first part of aggregation in BigQuery and to return back a Pandas dataset and then work with smaller Pandas dataset locally.     



Invoking Machine Learning APIs.  ML APIs are microservices.  Clone code repo within Cloud Datalab environment.  Invoke ML APIs.  Vision API to detect text in an image. Translate API to translate that text into English.  Natural Language API to find the sentiment of some famous quotes.  Speech API to transcribe an audio file.
